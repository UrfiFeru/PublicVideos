# PublicVideos
NOTE:
Vimeo added in same player as DailyMotion.

BUGS:
1. Exception shows when click on video or search  quickly which is "the content of adapter has changed but listview did not receive a notification."

2. Youtube player not working. (Dont know always or sometimes) Activity not added in manifest.

3. When app is minimized and then opended again, last search remains which is fine, however the same progress bar appears which appears on the start of app and the search title is changed.

4. Check if loadmore is working properly.

5. Add trending results at the start of the app.

6. Change download icon.

7. Duration should be added in the results as this is an important field.

8. Vimeo does not give the owner of the video. (Something may be done about that)

9. Find other bugs and add in this list 




Tasks:

First add if only YT,DM or Vimeo results are to be shown in settings filter. Will make unit testing a lot easier.

Find common search filters
