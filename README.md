# PublicVideos
NOTE:
Vimeo added in same player as DailyMotion.

BUGS:


1. Exception shows when click on video or search  quickly which is "the content of adapter has changed but listview did not receive a notification."

2. When app is minimized and then opended again, last search remains which is fine, however the same progress bar appears which appears on the start of app and the search title is changed.

3. Check if loadmore is working properly. (Seems to work fine)

4. Add trending results at the start of the app.

5. App is restarted when download notification is clicked. Something else should happen here. I dont know what but not what is happening now. 


6. Duration should be added in the results as this is an important field.

7. Vimeo does not give the owner of the video. (Something may be done about that)

8. Find other bugs and add in this list 








Tasks:

First add if only YT,DM or Vimeo results are to be shown in settings filter. Will make unit testing a lot easier.

Find common search filters

Add download progress bar notification

Something to cancel ongoing download.

Maybe bookmark videos?
